# My-Portfolio---Tim-Gold

## Description

I wanted to create a portfolio to highlight my projects, skills, link my github and linkedin. Also I wanted to tell people who I am, why I have a passion for coding, and leave a picture so they can put a face to name. This portfolio is for my future employer to see what projects I have done and my capabilities in web development. I was able to continue to heighten my skills with react.
